The sidebar in Pathfinder is configured through a TypeScript file that defines the structure and order of your documentation sections.

<Aside variant="info">
  Any items not configured are still included, they will just have their default label and alphabetical display order.
</Aside>

## Configuration File

The sidebar navigation is configured in `src/docs/config/[language]/sidebarNavData.json.ts`. This file exports an array of section configurations.

```ts title="src/docs/config/[language]/sidebarNavData.json.ts"
/**
 * Ordered list of documentation sections
 * The order here determines the display order in navigation
 */
const docSections: DocSection[] = [
	{
		id: "getting-started",
		title: "Getting Started",
	},
	{
		id: "components",
		title: "Components",
	},
	{
		id: "reference",
		title: "Reference",
	},
];
```

## Section Properties

Each section in the `docSections` array has the following properties:

- `id` (required): Must match the folder name under `src/data/docs/`. For example, if your id is "getting-started", your documentation files should be in `src/data/docs/[language]/getting-started/`.

- `title` (required): The display title for the section in the sidebar navigation. This can include spaces and special characters.

## Order and Organization

The order of sections in the `docSections` array determines their display order in the sidebar navigation. To reorder sections, simply reorder them in the array.

## Adding New Sections

To add a new section to your documentation:

1. Create a new folder under `src/data/docs/` with your section's ID
2. Add a new section configuration to the `docSections` array
3. Add your documentation files (`.md` or `.mdx`) to your new section folder

```ts
const docSections: DocSection[] = [
  // ... existing sections ...
  {
    id: "advanced-topics",
    title: "Advanced Topics",
    description: "In-depth guides and advanced usage",
  },
];
```
